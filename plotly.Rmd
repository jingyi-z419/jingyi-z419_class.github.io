```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) %>%
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    price %in% 100:500,
    room_type == "Entire home/apt"
  ) %>%
  drop_na(rating)
```
